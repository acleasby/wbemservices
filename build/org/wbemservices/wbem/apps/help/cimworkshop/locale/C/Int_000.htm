<h3>Integer</h3>
<p>Use this dialog box to assign a numeric value for a new property.</p>
<p>The Value field on this Set value dialog box accepts only a signed or an unsigned integer of a specified size or null (empty value). 
An unsigned integer can be a positive whole number only. 
CIM properties that have values that are unsigned integers can be 8 bits, 
16 bits, 
32 bits, 
or 64 bits in size. 
Depending on the size of the unsigned integer that makes up the value of the property,
type these values in the Value field:
<ul><li><p>For a property that is an 8-bit unsigned integer, 
type a positive numeric value equivalent to 8 bits.</p>
</li>
<li><p>For a property that is a 16-bit unsigned integer, 
type a positive numeric value equivalent to 16 bits.</p>
</li>
<li><p>For a property that is a 32-bit unsigned integer, 
type a positive numeric value equivalent to 32 bits.</p>
</li>
<li><p>For a property that is a 64-bit unsigned integer, 
type a positive numeric value equivalent to 64 bits.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>A signed integer can be a negative or positive whole number. 
CIM properties that contain values that are signed integers can be 8 bits, 
16 bits, 
32 bits, 
or 64 bits in size. 
Depending on the size of the signed integer that makes up the value of the property, 
type these values in the Value field:
<ul><li><p>For a property that is an 8-bit signed integer, 
type a positive or negative numeric value equivalent to 8 bits.</p>
</li>
<li><p>For a property that is a 16-bit signed integer, 
type a positive or negative numeric value equivalent to 16 bits.</p>
</li>
<li><p>For a property that is a 32-bit signed integer, 
type a positive or negative numeric value equivalent to 32 bits.</p>
</li>
<li><p>For a property that is a 64-bit signed integer, 
type a positive or negative numeric value equivalent to 64 bits.</p>
</li>
</ul>
