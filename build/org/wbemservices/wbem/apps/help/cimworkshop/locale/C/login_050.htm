<h3>Transfer Protocol</h3>
<p>Use this field to specify the transfer protocol that you want to use</p>
<p>By default, 
CIM WorkShop uses the CIM-XML protocol to connect to the CIM Object Manager on the local host, 
in the default namespace, 
<kbd>root\cimv2</kbd>. 
You can select CIM-RMI if you want to communicate to a CIM Object Manager by using the proprietary RMI protocol. 
When your host establishes a connection, 
all classes that are contained in the specified namespace are displayed in the left pane on the CIM WorkShop main window.</p>
