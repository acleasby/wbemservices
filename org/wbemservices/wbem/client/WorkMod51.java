/**
 * Implements the UNIX crypt(3) function, based on a direct port of the
 * libc crypt function.
 *
 * <p>
 * From the crypt man page:
 * <p>
 * crypt() is the password encryption routine, based on the NBS
 * Data  Encryption  Standard,  with variations intended (among
 * other things) to frustrate use of  hardware  implementations
 * of the DES for key search.
 * <p>
 * The first argument to crypt() is  normally  a  user's  typed
 * password.   The  second  is a 2-character string chosen from
 * the set [a-zA-Z0-9./].  the  salt string is used to perturb 
 * the DES algorithm in one
 * of 4096 different ways, after which the password is used  as
 * the  key  to  encrypt  repeatedly  a  constant  string.  The
 * returned value points to the encrypted password, in the same
 * alphabet as the salt.  The first two characters are the salt
 * itself.
