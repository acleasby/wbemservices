/**
  * The CommonServerSecurityContext interface defines a small set
  * of accessor methods which can be called by the CIMOM server
  * to return security information to providers.  This interface
  * will be implemented by both the WBEM ServerSecurity and
  * Viper ServerSecurityContext infrastructure server objects.
  * Each infrastructure will set the current session's server security
  * instance reference caste to this interface into a ThreadLocal
  * variable in the XXXX class in this same WBEM server Java package.
  * This thread local variable must be set for every remote method
  * call from a WBEM client, and for every intra-server call from
  * the Viper server (or any of its services).
  * <p>
  * The XXXX class contains a static method to return the reference
  * to the server security instance implementing this interface.
  * Per session information can then be retrieved from the interface
  * accessor methods.  Additional WBEM security information can be
  * obtained by casting this reference to the WBEM ServerSecurity
  * instance (if the caste fails, its a Viper ServerSecurityContext
  * instance and cannot be used for further information).
