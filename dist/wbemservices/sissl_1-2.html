			Source Code version of Original Code may be distributed only under
			the terms of this License or a future version of this License
			released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this
			License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may
			not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that
			alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the
			recipients' rights hereunder. Your license for shipment of the
			Contributor Version is conditioned upon Your full compliance with
			this Section. The Modifications which You create must comply with
			all requirements set out by the Standards body in effect one
			hundred twenty (120) days before You ship the Contributor Version.
			In the event that the Modifications do not meet such requirements,
			You agree to publish either (i) any deviation from the Standards
			protocol resulting from implementation of Your Modifications and a
			reference implementation of Your Modifications or (ii) Your
			Modifications in Source Code form, and to make any such deviation
			and reference implementation or Modifications available to all

			free basis within thirty (30) days of Your first customer shipment

			include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory)
			where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You
			created one or more Modification(s) You may add Your name as a
			Contributor to the notice described in <B>Exhibit A</B>. You must
			also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source
			Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights
			relating to Initial Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a
			fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to
			one or more recipients of Your version of the Code. However, You
			may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the
			Initial Developer. You must make it absolutely clear than any such
			warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by
			You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer
			for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer as a result of
			warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

			Source Code version of the Original Code is available under the
			terms of this License. The notice must be conspicuously included
			in any notice in an Executable or Source versions, related
			documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients'
			rights relating to the Original Code. You may distribute the
			Executable and Source versions of Your version of the Code or
			ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain
			terms different from this License, provided that You are in
			compliance with the terms of this License. If You distribute the
			Executable and Source versions under a different license You must
			make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this
			License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer.
