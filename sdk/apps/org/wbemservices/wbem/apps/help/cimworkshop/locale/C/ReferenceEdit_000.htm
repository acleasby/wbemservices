<h3>Reference</h3>
<p>Use this dialog box to edit the reference property of an association class.</p>
<p>When you set the value of a reference to a class, 
you are setting an instance. 
On the Set value dialog box, 
you can choose an instance of that class or you can manually set the values of the keys.</p>
<p>A reference property is a pointer to another class 
(or instance).</p>
<p>For each instance of the referred-to class, 
you can either:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Directly edit the value of the key properties</li>
<li>Select an instance of the referred-to class, 
and in doing so, 
define the key properties from that instance.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>To directly edit the value of any key property, 
click the key property in the column under Value.</p>
<p><b>Note</b>:&nbsp;If you are creating a static association instance that you want to store in the repository, 
the reference itself must point to a static instance in the repository.</p>
