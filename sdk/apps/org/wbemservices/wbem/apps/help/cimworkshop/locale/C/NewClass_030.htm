<h3>Delete Property</h3>
<p>Click this button to delete a property that you have created for a subclass. 
For example, 
if you create a property and determine that you will not use it or that you do not need it, 
you can delete it.</p>
<p>You can delete only a property that you are creating in a new class. 
Otherwise, 
you can view, 
but not modify or delete, 
properties of classes. 
You cannot delete an inherited property in a subclass.
