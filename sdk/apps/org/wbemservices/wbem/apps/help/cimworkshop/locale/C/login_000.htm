<p>In the left pane on this dialog box, 
Context Help is displayed. 
When you click in a field, 
new information that describes how to use that particular field is displayed in the Context Help pane.</p>
<p>In the CIM WorkShop Login dialog box,

<li><p>Your password</p>
</li>
<li><p>The transfer protocol you want to use: CIM-XML or CIM-RMI</p>

When your host establishes a connection, 
all classes that are contained in the specified namespace are displayed in the left pane on the CIM WorkShop main window.</p>
